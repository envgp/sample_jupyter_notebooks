        "**Preface**:  It is not GPGN268's goal to teach you all of Python.  Learning the language in a semester is difficult enough, and we only have a couple weeks.  Instead, our goal is to teach you just enough Python so that you can apply the basics of it to geophysical data analysis.  We're going to skip over some *very* important coding concepts, such as classes and objects, dictionaries, and exceptions.  These are certainly good things to know, and in the future you will need to learn them if you work in a geoscience job with a heavy emphasis on Python.  However, right now, said topics are not our priority.\n",

        "This notebook is meant as a quick and dirty introduction to some fundamental Python concepts.  There is not much space for dedicated practice of the introduced concepts, but you're encouraged to mess around in the code blocks and experiment.  Think of this notebook as something to keep on hand as a reference on core Python syntax.  There's also some links to where you can find more information.\n",

        "If you have some coding experience, the majority of this notebook will be purely review.

        "Note that I'm explaining what I'm doing as well as why I'm doing it.  You don't always have to explain your 'why', but sometimes it helps put code in context.  Also note how I didn't explain every single line of code.  I don't need to explain what `print()` does; people should know that.  I also avoid stating the obvious, like \"I'm adding 3 to the input\".  Everyone can see that I'm adding 3; they may be asking themselves what purpose that's accomplishing.  Maybe it accounts for an edge effect in a graphic, or it corrects an equation in a model, etc.  Think about your audience when writing your comments.  Be descriptive enough that they know what you're doing, but don't be overly verbose to the point where the comments are useless.  Keep it short and impactful.\n",

        "There's a couple other flavors of comments/textual description.  At the start of some IDEs, such as Spyder, you may see what look like a comment that begins with three single quotes, spans multiple lines, and ends with three single quotes.  This is called a docstring, which is an important concept that's outside the scope of this class.  It's kind of like a mega-comment that explains what an entire program or function does.  Certain programs can find docstrings and combine them together to create documentation for a set of scripts.  Don't worry about including docstrings in your code for this class.  Just include well-written comments so we can follow what you're doing."
